Warp threads are first stretched onto a wooden loom and then weavers use a shuttle to carry polychrome weft threads across the warp—not the entire textile—leaving a subtle space between the colours. Such a distinctive appearance is thought to resemble cut or carved silk. Basic weaving techniques Developed by generations of weavers, the primary techniques include gou (‘connecting’) for defining the silhouette of patterns, along with guan (‘flinging’), jie (‘knotting’) and qiang (‘propping’). Each technique employs similar tones of polychrome wefts to achieve a gradation of colours.  Silhouettes of kingfishers outlined in the gou (‘connecting’) technique; bluish feathers woven in the guan (‘flinging’) technique.   fullscreen   Silhouettes of kingfishers outlined in the gou (‘connecting’) technique; bluish feathers woven in the guan (‘flinging’) technique.    gou (‘connecting’) Wefts that differ from the colour of the subject motif are used to outline the motif’s silhouette.\nguan (‘flinging’) Two or more similar tones of coloured wefts follow the silhouette of the patterns.

Surrounded by a pleasing scene of trees, mountains, flowers and a pagoda, each child strikes a unique expression and pose. During the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties, the Yingxi tu design appeared on textiles, furniture, ceramics and other decorative objects to represent the desire for a large family. In the mid-Qing dynasty, kesi weaving techniques and technologies were sufficiently advanced to allow for the widespread production of textiles with identical double-sided imagery that did not expose the threads on either side—shuangmian touke (‘double-sided translucent silk tapestry’). Panels like this, with attractive identical images on the front and back, were often used as two-sided screens for desks or room dividers, the latter typically placed in the wedding chamber of a newly married couple.\n","id":6,"length":145,"title":"Boys at play","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/textiles/5_catalogue/1/"},{"content":"Over thirty Daoist immortals, such as Shoulao (the God of Longevity), the Eight Immortals, Hehe Immortals and Magu, the Goddess of Longevity, adorn these scrolls, along with auspicious mythical creatures such as qilins and phoenixes. A group of immortals is shown surrounded by two trees bearing abundant xiantao, accompanied by waves and clouds. Various weaving techniques create the vivid imagery of the second hanging scroll. In order to highlight the figures’ silhouettes, the gou (‘connecting’) technique was used to outline the robes, while the rocks and ocean waves were woven with the changduanqiang (‘long-and-short propping’) technique. This process employs various long and short, light- and dark-coloured wefts that offset each other to create a fluid and natural colouration. Another similar method known as mushuqiang (‘wood comb propping’), in which wefts of similar tones are woven into a comb-like edge pattern, creates the reddish pink xiantao.\nKesi showing gatherings of immortals were popular among the upper-class in the Qing dynasty because of their auspicious connotations of longevity and prosperity. They were typically displayed indoors or exchanged between scholars as gifts.\n","id":7,"length":179,"title":"Gathering of immortals","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/textiles/5_catalogue/2/"},{"content":"Accompanied by a phoenix and a child attendant holding a ruyi (a wish-granting wand or scepter), the figure on this scroll is Magu, the Goddess of Longevity.

Here, she carries two wine cups and a lingzhi mushroom on a platter, from which she brews longevity wine for the birthday banquet of the Queen Mother of the West. The white pearls of her headdress were painted with brushes using a technique known as kehua (‘silk tapestry and painting’), which is characteristic of kesi produced during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736–95). The choice of this figure—together with auspicious chrysanthemums and five bats surrounding a shou (longevity) character on her dress—suggests that the tapestry was intended as a birthday present, most likely for a woman.\n","id":8,"length":151,"title":"Magu offering wine","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/textiles/5_catalogue/3/"},{"content":"Recognised as the ‘King of Flowers’ and a symbol of wealth and honour, blossoming peonies express the wish huakai fugui (‘may you be prosperous’), and have traditionally been favoured on objects owned by scholars and nobles. The brightly coloured peonies and leaves were woven in various shades of red, pink, orange and green weft threads using the changduanqiang (‘long-and-short propping’) technique. Its dazzling golden ground was created with the kejin (‘silk tapestry woven with gold’) technique, in which twisted gold threads are made by wrapping a yellow silk thread with thin sheets of gold leaf in a spiral twist. This technique provides the tapestry a particularly luxurious and elegant appearance.\nThe seal Lantang shuwu refers to the ‘Blue Pool Studio’ owned by Li Wailuo (b. 1929), a connoisseur and art educator in Hong Kong. Having graduated from the Northcote College of Education in 1950s, Li taught design, painting and art history at the Grantham College of Education until his retirement in 1984.\n","id":9,"length":162,"title":"Peonies","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/textiles/5_catalogue/4/"},{"content":"A pair of mandarin ducks rests on a riverbank beneath branches of peach blossoms. Each is coloured and posed differently: the duck with golden neck feathers gazes forward, while the duck with black feathers leans its head back to groom its body. Their colourful feathers were woven using the changduanqiang (‘long-and-short propping’) and mushuqiang (‘wood comb propping’) techniques. The subtle gradation of greyish-green grass beneath the ducks was woven with the fengweiqiang (‘phoenix tale propping’) technique, wherein two weft threads, one thicker and one thinner, are interwoven to create a graceful flow of colours.\nIn traditional Chinese culture, mandarin ducks symbolise a harmonious marriage as they are thought to mate for life. The peach blossoms expand on this theme since they bloom in spring, a time of fertility. The design of the kesi was likely inspired by the Song dynasty (960–1279) hanging scroll Taohua yuanyang tu zhou (Peach Blossom and Mandarin Ducks), held in the collection of the Nanjing Museum. This is also indicated by the four characters in black-coloured wefts, taohua yuanyang, and a seal in bronze script woven in the top right corner of the tapestry that reads: song ren suo zuo (‘an artwork made by the people of the Song dynasty’).\n","id":10,"length":204,"title":"Mandarin ducks and peach blossoms","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/textiles/5_catalogue/5/"},{"content":"Woven in polychrome wefts against a blue ground, the birds on this kesi are black-naped golden orioles. Woven in the changduanqiang (‘long-and-short propping’) technique, the magnolias in beige and light green colours grant the flowers a sense of simple beauty. The yellow bodies of the orioles were woven in a technique known as baoxinqiang (‘embracing propping’), in which the shading of colours moves smoothly from the edge towards the centre, resulting in a darker outer area and lighter centre.\nThe finely woven feathers, claws and beaks of the orioles, as well as the magnolias, offer a vivid illustration of spring. A seal inscription on the lower left reads Shen Jinshui, indicating that the tapestry was woven by Shen Jinshui (1883–1968), who was born in Likou, Wu county, Jiangsu province. Shen Jinshui began learning kesi weaving at the age of fifteen. One of the three most prominent kesi weavers in Suzhou, he reportedly served in the imperial workshops of the Forbidden City and was invited to teach kesi weaving at the Suzhou Cixiu Yanjiusuo (‘Suzhou Embroidery Research Institute’) in the 1950s. Shen taught many influential weavers, including Wang Jinshan (b. 1939), who was designated by the government as a Representative Inheritor (chuanchen ren) of Suzhou kesi weaving.

Artisans would use silk gauze as the ground fabric and then penetrate coloured silk threads in the holes of the gauze to create patterns. There are two types of silk gauze embroidery: when the silk gauze ground is completely covered by the embroidered patterns it is called najinxiu (‘full count’); when part of the underlying gauze is revealed, as with the dragon robe here, it is known as nashaxiu. Embroidered items for the imperial court were manufactured by imperial embroidery workshops (xiufang) established during the Qing dynasty in Jiangning, Suzhou and Hangzhou. Dragon robes often took over one hundred and ninety days to complete.\nAccording to Daqing huidian (Collected Statutes of the Great Qing), an official text describing the clothing system, golden yellow was reserved for the emperor; the blue-coloured dragon robes were worn by princes of the first and second rank, and purple red-coloured robes were often worn by noblemen. In the imperial dress hierarchy, robes with the five-clawed dragon motif worn by princes or noblemen were called a mangpao, while the emperor wore a longpao. The slits on the centre front of both robes mark them as men’s garments. Although there were prohibitions on wearing dragon motifs and the golden yellow colour, exquisitely refined silk was available for purchase, and the imperial silk was also presented as diplomatic gifts.\n","id":12,"length":250,"title":"Dragon robe","type":"entry","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/textiles/5_catalogue/7/"},{"content":"The designs on this panel illustrate a peaceful landscape of noble ladies and children playing, each with a different character and facial expression using a range of coloured threads. A pavilion, fences, ornamental rocks and trees create a typical Chinese garden scene often found in paintings and illustrations that reveals the leisurely life of wealthy women in ancient China.\nThe choice of decoration is complemented by the work’s medium; embroidery, also known as nugong (‘women’s work’) was an important pastime for wealthy young women in dynastic China. In her Xiupu (Treatise on Embroidery, 1821), the noted artisan Ding Pei, active during the reigns of the Jiaqing (1796–1820) and Daoguang (1821–50) Emperors, recognised embroidery as the feminine art of writing, with the needle serving as one’s brush, the silk as paper and the floss as ink.

This technique was often used on embroidered paintings or calligraphy to vividly depict flora and fauna, as well as Chinese characters.

This agreement declared the neutrality of Southeast China in the war between the court of Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) and the Eight-Nation Alliance of foreign powers during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).\nEach of the banners feature a large golden shou (longevity) character that was first embroidered with images of various Daoist immortals stitched onto a red satin ground.\nThe colourfully shaded bats around the shou character were embroidered using a technique called qiangzhen (‘encroaching satin stitch’), in which short straight stitches were embroidered layer upon layer, resulting in a shading of colours that move from light to dark.
