Embroidery refers to the decorative textile technique in which a needle stitches polychrome threads onto a ground fabric in order to create the patterns. Needles, thread, scissors and frames are the four major tools for creating an embroidery.


### Commonly used embroidery techniques
A variety of embroidery stitches were developed over the generations for outlining patterns, shading colours, adding three-dimensionality and for representing surface textures.


#### *qizhen* (‘straight stitch’)

Parallel straight stitches form the patterns; these stitches can run vertically, horizontally or obliquely.

#### *qiangzhen* (‘encroaching satin stitch’)

Short straight stitches are embroidered in layers, resulting in the shading of colours from light to dark or pale to dark.

#### *taozhen* (‘long-and-short stitch’)

Dark- and light-coloured long and short stitches offset to create a fluid and natural colouration.

#### *wangxiu* (‘net embroidery’)

Straight, oblique and parallel threads crisscross to form a net-like pattern.
