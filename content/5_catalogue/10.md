This longevity banner was presented to Xu
Yingkui (1830–1903), the Qing Governor-General of
Fujian and Zhejiang, to commemorate his seventieth
birthday in 1900. He was well-known in China
for concluding the ‘Mutual Protection of Southeast
China’ (*dongnan hubao*) agreement with other provincial
governors and high-ranking officials, such as Zhang
Zhidong (1837–1909) and Liu Kunyi (1830–1902). This
agreement declared the neutrality of Southeast China
in the war between the court of Empress Dowager Cixi
(1835–1908) and the Eight-Nation Alliance of foreign
powers during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).
