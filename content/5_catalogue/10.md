A pair of longevity banners were presented to Xu
Yingkui (1830–1903), the Qing Governor-General of
Fujian and Zhejiang, to commemorate his seventieth
birthday in 1900. He was well-known in China
for concluding the ‘Mutual Protection of Southeast
China’ (*dongnan hubao*) agreement with other provincial
governors and high-ranking officials, such as Zhang
Zhidong (1837–1909) and Liu Kunyi (1830–1902). This
agreement declared the neutrality of Southeast China
in the war between the court of Empress Dowager Cixi
(1835–1908) and the Eight-Nation Alliance of foreign
powers during the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).

This banner features a large golden *shou* (longevity)
character that was first embroidered with images of various
Daoist immortals stitched onto a red satin ground.

The colourfully shaded bats around the *shou* character
were embroidered using a technique called *qiangzhen*
(‘encroaching satin stitch’), in which short straight stitches
were embroidered layer upon layer, resulting in a shading
of colours that move from light to dark. Embroidered silk
banners like these were often used to decorate interiors
during birthday or wedding banquets, or as wall hangings
in temple lecture halls.
