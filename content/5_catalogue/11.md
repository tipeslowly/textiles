Shoulao, the Daoist God of Longevity, appears on this banner, along with an inscription stating that it was
presented by Wu Songyang (1846–1916) to Xu on the
occasion of his seventy-third birthday. The text reads:

*gaoshou guanglu dafu yunshuai xiantai fuzi daren qi zhi jin
san rongqing*

(‘for the seventy-third birthday of Yunshuai, the Grand
Master of Splendid Happiness and the Governor-General’)

*sanpin xian fujian shiyong dao shouye wusongyang kou zhu*

(‘sincere wishes from student Wu Songyang, the third-ranking
*shiyongdao* of Fujian’)

Surrounding Shoulao are various embroidered symbols
of longevity, including a peach, several cranes and five
bats. The number of bats is significant as the Chinese
characters for bat and fortune are both pronounced *fu*, and
symbolise the ‘Five Blessings’ of longevity, health, wealth,
and a virtuous life and natural death.
