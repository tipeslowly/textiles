Shoulao, the Daoist God of
Longevity, appears on this banner, along with an inscription stating that it was
presented by Wu Songyang (1846–1916) to Xu on the
occasion of his seventy-third birthday. The text reads:

*gaoshou guanglu dafu yunshuai xiantai fuzi daren qi zhi jin
san rongqing*

(‘for the seventy-third birthday of Yunshuai, the Grand
Master of Splendid Happiness and the Governor-General’)

*sanpin xian fujian shiyong dao shouye wusongyang kou zhu*

(‘sincere wishes from student Wu Songyang, the third-ranking
*shiyongdao* of Fujian’)

Surrounding Shoulao are various embroidered symbols
of longevity, including a peach, several cranes and five
bats. The number of bats is significant—as the Chinese
characters for bat and fortune are both pronounced *fu*, they
symbolise the ‘Five Blessings’ of longevity, health, wealth,
and a virtuous life and natural death. The other two
banners feature large golden *shou* (longevity) characters
that were first embroidered with images of various
Daoist immortals stitched onto a red satin ground.

The colourfully shaded bats around the *shou* characters
were embroidered using a technique called *qiangzhen*
(‘encroaching satin stitch’), in which short straight stitches
were embroidered layer upon layer, resulting in a shading
of colours moving from light to dark. Embroidered silk
banners like these were often used to decorate interiors
during birthday or wedding banquets, or as wall hangings
in temple lecture halls.
