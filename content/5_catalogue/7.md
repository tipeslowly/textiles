This dragon robe is embroidered with five-clawed
dragons and other auspicious motifs, such as cranes,
clouds and the character for longevity in the *nashaxiu*
or *chuoshaxiu* (‘counted stitch’) technique. Artisans
would use silk gauze as the ground fabric and then
penetrate coloured silk threads in the holes of the gauze
to create patterns. There are two types of silk gauze
embroidery: when the silk gauze ground is completely
covered by the embroidered patterns it is called *najinxiu*
(‘full count’); when part of the underlying gauze is
revealed, as with the dragon robe here, it is known
as *nashaxiu*. Embroidered items for the imperial court
were manufactured by imperial embroidery workshops
(*xiufang*) established during the Qing dynasty in Jiangning,
Suzhou and Hangzhou. Dragon robes often took over one
hundred and ninety days to complete.

According to *Daqing huidian* (Collected Statutes of the Great
Qing), an official text describing the clothing system,
golden yellow was reserved for the emperor; the blue-coloured
dragon robes were worn by princes of the first
and second rank, and purple red-coloured robes were
often worn by noblemen. In the imperial dress hierarchy,
robes with the five-clawed dragon motif worn by princes
or noblemen were called a *mangpao*, while
the emperor wore a *longpao*. The slits
on the centre front of both robes mark them as men’s
garments. Although there were prohibitions on wearing
dragon motifs and the golden yellow colour, exquisitely
refined silk was available for purchase, and the imperial
silk was also presented as diplomatic gifts.
