The couplet on this panel was written by the Qing dynasty
official and calligrapher Weng Tonghe (1830–1904).
Embroidered in silk threads against a beige background,
the text reads:

*yun zheng shan gu xiu*

(‘steaming clouds rising from the hills display the
spirit and resonance of graceful mountains’)

*hua yun shu shen nong*

(‘flowers nourish luxuriant trees’)

*pingan*

[the art name of Weng Tonghe]

Weng Tonghe

Born in Changsu, Jiangsu province into a family of means,
Weng became a *jinshi* (a recipient of the highest and final
degree in the imperial examinations of Imperial China)
civil service candidate in 1856, and served as the Grand
Secretary and instructor of the Tongzhi (r. 1861–74) and
Guangxu (r. 1875–1908) Emperors.

To better capture the delicate shading of Weng’s
brushwork, the weaver has used the *taozhen* (‘long-and-short
stitch’) technique, in which a fluid and natural
colouration is achieved by offsetting adjacent rows of
stitches with fine silk threads split into four or five strands
each. This technique was often used on embroidered
paintings or calligraphy to vividly depict flora and fauna,
as well as Chinese characters. Two of Weng’s seals in
red-coloured threads, including ‘Weng Tonghe’ and his
courtesy name ‘shuping’, are reminiscent of Chinese
calligraphy.
