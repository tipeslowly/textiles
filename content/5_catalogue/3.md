Accompanied by a phoenix and a child attendant holding
a *ruyi* (a wish-granting wand or scepter), the figure on this
scroll is Magu, the Goddess of Longevity. According to
Daoist myth, Magu became an immortal and witnessed
the Eastern ocean dry up and turn into mulberry fields
three times, indicating her transcendence of time. Here,
she carries two wine cups and a *lingzhi* mushroom on
a platter, from which she brews longevity wine for the
birthday banquet of the Queen Mother of the West. The
white pearls of her headdress were painted with brushes
using a technique known as *kehua* (‘silk tapestry and
painting’), which is characteristic of *kesi* produced during
the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736–95). The choice
of this figure—together with auspicious chrysanthemums
and five bats surrounding a *shou* (longevity) character on
her dress—suggests that the tapestry was intended as a
birthday present, most likely for a woman.
