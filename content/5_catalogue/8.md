The designs on this panel illustrate a peaceful landscape
of noble ladies and children playing, each with a different
character and facial expression using a range of
coloured threads. A pavilion, fences, ornamental rocks and
trees create a typical Chinese garden scene often found in
paintings and illustrations that reveals the leisurely life of
wealthy women in ancient China.

The choice of decoration is complemented by the
work’s medium; embroidery, also known as *nugong*
(‘women’s work’) was an important pastime for wealthy
young women in dynastic China. In her *Xiupu* (Treatise
on Embroidery, 1821), the noted artisan Ding Pei,
active during the reigns of the Jiaqing (1796–1820) and
Daoguang (1821–50) Emperors, recognised embroidery
as the feminine art of writing, with the needle serving
as one’s brush, the silk as paper and the floss as ink. The
production of such works was thought to cultivate the
moral character and technical skill of young women, and
embroidered handkerchiefs, sashes and shoes were also
popular items for a women’s trousseau.
