Recognised as the ‘King of Flowers’ and a symbol of
wealth and honour, blossoming peonies express the
wish *huakai fugui* (‘may you be prosperous’), and have
traditionally been favoured on objects owned by scholars
and nobles. The brightly coloured peonies and leaves
were woven in various shades of red, pink, orange and
green weft threads using the *changduanqiang* (‘long-and-short
propping’) technique. Its dazzling golden ground
was created with the *kejin* (‘silk tapestry woven with
gold’) technique, in which twisted gold threads are made
by wrapping a yellow silk thread with thin sheets of gold
leaf in a spiral twist. This technique provides the tapestry
a particularly luxurious and elegant appearance.

The seal *Lantang shuwu* refers to the ‘Blue
Pool Studio’ owned by Li Wailuo (b. 1929), a connoisseur
and art educator in Hong Kong. Having graduated from the
Northcote College of Education in 1950s, Li taught design,
painting and art history at the Grantham College of Education
until his retirement in 1984.
