Textiles shown in this section are all from the collection of the
University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG), The University of
Hong Kong (HKU). UMAG’s textile collection
has developed over the past several decades through generous
donations by individuals affiliated with the University of Hong Kong
and private collectors. Several embroidery pieces were donated by
Dr Hui Wai Haan, who taught in HKU’s Department of Chemistry for
nearly four decades, and the entire *kesi* silk tapestry collection was donated
by Dr Lam Kwok Pun.

The textiles have been dated according to their weaving or embroidery
techniques, use of materials, or established information on individual
weavers. The comparative discussion of silk tapestry and embroidery
is based on the traditional juxtaposition of these two mediums in
historical texts, including catalogues of the imperial collection such
as *Midian zhulin* (The Pearl Forest in the Secret Hall) (1744), *Shiqu baoji*
(Catalogue of Painting and Calligraphy in the Qianlong Imperial Collection)
(1745), and the monographs *Qing neifu cang kesi xiuxian shuhua lu*
(Catalogue of Kesi Silk Tapestry Woven and Silk Embroidered Calligraphy
and Painting in the Collection of the Imperial Household Department) (1930)
and *Sixiu biji* (Notes on Silk and Embroidery) (1933).
