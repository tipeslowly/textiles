Embroidered against a pale-yellow background, this silk
satin scroll was a gift presented to Sir Frederick Lugard
(1858–1945), the fourteenth British Governor of Hong
Kong (1907–12), by eighty-four local Chinese *shenshang*
(prominent ‘gentry-merchants’ who exchanged wealth for
social status or official titles, and who were often actively
involved in charitable affairs) in 1910. It was presented to
Lugard in recognition of his contributions while governor,
which included founding the University of Hong Kong
and prohibiting the practice of abandoning corpses on
the streets, which remained widespread in the nineteenth
century.

Stored in an ornately carved red sandalwood casket
adorned with bat-shaped silver brackets, the scroll is
delicately embroidered with auspicious motifs, such as
mandarin ducks and butterflies symbolising harmonious
relationships and joyfulness. A striking pair of peacocks
on the scroll, emblematic of culture and virtue according
to the *I-Ching* (Book of Changes), likely echoes an
inscription *deyin xiangjiang* (‘virtue shelters Hong Kong’)
on the casket's lid, which glorifies the success and
prosperity of Hong Kong during Lugard’s tenure.
