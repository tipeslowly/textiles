A pair of mandarin ducks rests on a riverbank beneath branches of
peach blossoms. Each is coloured and posed differently:
the duck with golden neck feathers gazes forward,
while the duck with black feathers leans its head back
to groom its body. Their colourful feathers were woven
using the *changduanqiang* (‘long-and-short propping’) and
*mushuqiang* (‘wood comb propping’) techniques. The
subtle gradation of greyish-green grass beneath the ducks
was woven with the *fengweiqiang* (‘phoenix tale propping’)
technique, wherein two weft threads, one thicker and
one thinner, are interwoven to create a graceful flow of
colours.

In traditional Chinese culture, mandarin ducks symbolise
a harmonious marriage as they are thought to mate for
life. The peach blossoms expand on this theme since
they bloom in spring, a time of fertility. The design
of the *kesi* was likely inspired by the Song dynasty
(960–1279) hanging scroll *Taohua yuanyang tu zhou* (Peach
Blossom and Mandarin Ducks), held in the collection of
the Nanjing Museum. This is also indicated by the four
characters in black-coloured wefts, *taohua yuanyang*, and a
seal in bronze script woven in the top right corner of the
tapestry that reads: *song ren suo zuo* (‘an artwork made by
the people of the Song dynasty’).
